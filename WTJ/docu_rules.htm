					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font>
						<font size="+2"><a name="1.1">1.1 Scale</a></font><br> The standard ground
						scale for Republique is 36 scale meters per 1cm on the game board (27mm equals
						100 meters). Infantry and cavalry bases represent 550 men each. Artillery bases
						represent 12 guns each. Note that for game play, Republique artillery bases are
						still referred to as <i>batteries</i> even though most tactical-level artillery
						batteries of this period employed fewer guns. Each full turn represents
						approximately 40 minutes of battle time. </p> 
					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font>
						<a name="1.2"><font size="+2">1.2 Equipment</font></a><br> All game play is
						conducted using ten-sided dice with the number range on the dice representing
						the numbers one through ten (1 - 10), this means that the <b><i>0</i></b> on
						the die represents a <b><i>10</i></b>. A metric tape measure and
						<a href="http://www.wtj.com/games/beta/republique/chart_arc.gif" target="_new">firing arc</a> are also needed for
						measuring and targeting. The most important equipment are the many miniatures
						and markers you will want to fight battles. Below are some guidelines which
						Republique uses for its gaming system:<br> <br> <b>Death Caps</b> - A common
						feature of many wargames are <i>death caps</i>, which are used by most rules to
						indicate losses on multi-figure bases. In Republique, these same caps are used
						to indicate morale hits suffered by a formation. The caps should be colored
						white, yellow, red and black in order to indicate <i>disordered, rattled,
						shaken</i> and <i>demoralized</i> morale conditions respectively. A few
						additional caps may be painted bronze for indicating damage to artillery bases.
						Death caps are available at most hobby stores, although they can also be bought
						at industrial supply houses for a fraction of the cost ("death caps" are
						actually urethane protective caps used for various manufacturing processes).
						<br> <br> <b>Marker Bases</b> - Units wishing to execute special formations
						will need marker bases to indicate those actions. The two marker bases most
						needed for game play are <i>skirmish markers</i> and <i>square markers</i>:</p>
					 <br> <br> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Skirmish Markers</i></b> - Skirmish markers
						are used to depict skirmishers who have deployed out of their parent unit.
						Unlike the square marker defined below, skirmish markers represent an extension
						of their parent unit's combat capacity, and the skirmish markers themselves may
						conduct attacks that affect the morale of enemy units. Each skirmish marker
						base may only sustain one <i>base hit</i> before being destroyed and removed
						from play. The best way to create a skirmish base is by mounting a single light
						infantry figure on a small, round base (see base sizes below). </blockquote> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Square Markers</i></b> - Square markers
						indicate that all of a formation's sub-units (usually battalions) are formed
						into squares, which are potent anti-cavalry defenses. Unlike skirmish markers,
						square markers do not represent an extension of a unit's combat capacity, and
						therefore they cannot be attacked or destroyed. However the unit declared to be
						in square will be subject to all of the advantages and disadvantages associated
						with this special formation (see <a href="#0.4">Formations</a> below). The best
						way to create an <i>in square</i> marker is to place a single line infantry
						figure on a small, square base.</blockquote> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Other Markers</i></b> - A few other markers
						which are not mandatory but which add flavor to the game include breakthrough
						markers, which can be used to show where assault breakthroughs have occurred,
						and saved-fire markers, which can be used to show artillery batteries which
						have rested and prepared their guns by remaining inactive for one turn. An
						excellent breakthrough marker is an officer figure, especially one which is
						waving his sword, exhorting his men forward. A saved fire marker can easily be
						made by gluing together a small stack of four BBs (small metal balls) and then
						painting them black. In order to prevent game-board confusion, optional markers
						should be used only for temporary situations or for stationary units.

					 <p><b>Combat Bases</b> - Combat bases make up the primary
						combat units used for game play, including infantry, cavalry and artillery
						formations. Most wargame figures will be glued directly to the bases, which
						should be cut from thin sheets of wood or metal. Refer to the <i>Base Size
						Chart</i> above for a full listing of all base sizes and game scales directly
						supported by Republique. All of these base sizes are standard, and are
						available in pre-cut form. The figure scales most commonly used for Napoleonic
						wargaming are 6mm (1/300), 10mm, 15mm and 20mm, although other scales such as
						25mm are also widely used. <br><br>For game play purposes, unit composition is
						controlled by the number of combat bases, not the number of figures. This
						allows players to mount any number of miniatures they wish on their combat
						bases. Each base should also be marked on the upper rear or bottom with the
						name or number of the unit they represent. Infantry regiments will usually have
						a name or number. Brigades made up of weak regiments (a common situation for
						campaign armies) can use the name of the brigade commander or the number of the
						brigade. Cavalry brigades may also use the name of the brigade commander or
						senior regiment in the brigade. Artillery batteries should be marked with their
						size (heavy, medium or light). A more clinical identification alternative is to
						number all of your units using your own system (IE - unit 101 through 183) and
						then keep a list of what each number represents for that battle. <br><br>Each
						infantry or cavalry combat base can sustain only one <i>base hit</i> before
						being destroyed and removed from play. Each artillery base (also called a
						battery) may sustain two base hits before being destroyed and removed from
						play. An artillery base with one base hit is considered damaged and should be
						marked accordingly. Two damaged batteries may not merge to create a single
						undamaged battery. </p>

					 </tbody></table> 
					 <p><b>Infantry</b> - The standard infantry formation is the
						regiment. The only ongoing exception to this is the British army brigade, which
						is employed in the same manner as a regiment. Note that many historical orders
						of battle include very weak field strength units. These reduced formations may
						result in whole infantry brigades and even divisions operating as regiments on
						the gaming table. Some infantry regiments may deploy their own screens of light
						infantry using <i>skirmish markers</i>. Light infantry regiments may normally
						deploy one skirmish marker per active combat base. Line infantry regiments may
						&#8211; if skirmish capable &#8211; deploy one skirmish marker per regiment.
						Light regiments which lose combat bases will have the number of skirmish
						markers which they may deploy also reduced by one for each combat base lost.
						For additional information see troop lists and
						<a href="http://www.wtj.com/games/beta/republique/docu_optional.htm" target="">optional rules</a>. </p> 
					 <p><b>Cavalry</b> - The standard cavalry formation is the
						brigade. Before game play begins, players have the option of breaking up
						cavalry brigades and assigning their individual bases to other divisional level
						formations. The re-assigned base(s) must remain within the command radius of
						the new divisional commander but may otherwise move freely to support units
						within that division. These dispersed bases may be reformed back into their
						parent brigades by successfully rolling a <i>change of orders</i> and then
						moving the disparate units back to within the command radius of their original
						divisional commander or equivalent. These newly reconstituted cavalry brigades
						<i><b>may</b></i> join an assault on the same turn they reform, but only if no
						movement rules are violated as a result.</p> 
					 <p><b>Artillery</b> - Heavy artillery batteries represent 12
						pound cannon and their supporting howitzers. Medium artillery batteries
						represent 6 though 9 pound cannon and their supporting howitzers. Light
						batteries represent 3 and 4 pound cannon and their supporting howitzers.
						Artillery bases in Republique represent fairly packed batteries (minimum space
						between cannon), which is why there are no modifiers downgrading
						counter-battery fire. It takes two base hits to destroy an artillery combat
						base. After the first hit, the base is marked as damaged and will be destroyed
						if it receives a second base hit.</p>

						<a name="1.4"><font size="+2">1.4 Formations</font></a><br> Each group of bases
						representing a unit's deployment area are placed into specific
						<i>Formations</i>. Available formations include line, column, square and
						skirmish. Also available are <i>echelon</i>, a variation of a line, and
						<i>mixed</i>, a variation of column. The words "line" and "column" are only
						used to distinguish between shallow and deep unit dispositions, not to infer
						the formations of individual battalions or squadrons making up the regiments.
						Regardless of the regimental "formation," the sub-units of which they are
						composed are assumed to be in formations controlled by the local formation's
						commanders.</p> <img src="docu_rules_files/rulefig_00.gif" align="LEFT" height="288" width="360"> 
					 <p><b>Formation Examples</b> - At left are shown the major
						types of available formations, with the top of the page being the direction in
						which they are facing (note the <i>Direction of Movement</i> arrow). At upper
						left is shown the <i>mixed</i> formation, which is always two bases deep. At
						upper center is a unit in <i>line</i>, its stands are side by side and all
						facing in the same direction. At upper right is an <i>echelon</i> formation,
						which is a type of line used to angle a unit's flank line away from potential
						threats. Echelon may also be formed to the right instead of left (as shown), or
						off the center, which forms a wedge formation. At lower left is a two base unit
						with two skirmish markers deployed to its front. At lower center is an
						<i>attack column</i>, its stands are in single file facing the same direction.
						At lower right is a road column, it is formed into a T-shape, with all but one
						base placed into alternate facings. The one remaining base is placed at the
						"head" of the march column in the direction of movement. For movement and
						assault purposes, a road column's facing is controlled by the facing of the
						front guide base. For artillery targeting purposes however, the long axis of
						the column is used to align the enfilade arc (i.e. - when checking for status
						as a enfilade target, position the artillery arc off of the front and back ends
						of the road column, not off of the sides of the guide base).<br> <br>
						<b>Skirmish Markers</b> - At lower left in the formation diagram is an example
						of a small two stand unit deploying two skirmish markers. These markers are
						used to indicate skirmish troops which have been thrown forward by their parent
						units. See the <a href="http://www.wtj.com/games/beta/republique/rules_maneuver.htm#2.5">Maneuver</a> section for more
						about allowed distance between skirmish markers and their parent formations.
						Not all units are able to deploy skirmishers, and players should consult the
						troop lists for more information on each nation's particular skirmishing
						abilities or lack thereof.<br> <br> <b>Infantry Square</b> - Not shown are
						infantry squares, which are indicated using <i>square markers</i> in
						conjunction with existing formations. Only infantry units in mixed, line or
						echelon formations may use square markers. The markers themselves need only be
						placed in close proximity to a formation to indicate its "square" status. Units
						marked as being in square may move normally, but may not use the assault
						movement bonus, and must change to alternate formations (usually line or
						column) when passing through towns, woods, bridges and other obstacles. Units
						in square always count as enfilade artillery targets.</p> 
					 <p><b>Higher Formations</b> - The regiments and brigades
						discussed so far will usually be grouped into divisions for game play. These
						divisions will in turn be grouped into larger corps and armies or simply
						overseen by an overall commander. For a continuation of these next levels of
						battlefield organization see the <a href="http://www.wtj.com/games/beta/republique/rules_command.htm" target="">Command</a> section of the rules and the various troops lists posted
						on the main Republique page.</p> 
					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font>
						<font size="+2"><a name="1.5">1.5 The Battlefield</a></font><br> The terrain
						systems most commonly used for wargaming employ plateau-shaped hill segments in
						1" and/or ½" thicknesses. For game play, consider the 1" thick hills to
						be one level high/rough terrain and ½" hills to be one-half level
						high/normal terrain. Units within two inches of a hill's upper edge may spot
						and be spotted by those on lower levels, otherwise they are too far away from
						the edge of the plateau to establish line of sight. Treating gaming hills as
						the plateaus they usually resemble is the best way around most "ridge"
						arguments. This also creates dead ground along the bases of most hills, another
						realistic effect. Varying widths of masking tape may be used to show main and
						secondary roads. Colored felt, cardboard or cloth may be used to cover or
						outline the locations of woods, towns and fields. Scale trees and buildings may
						then be placed on these outlines, although these attractive additions are
						commonly pushed out of the way as large formations pass through. <br> <br> Each
						section of buildings actually represents a city block, which is why they are
						outlined. Troops inside these areas are not "in a building" but actually in a
						built up area which may include anything from fence-lines, plots of land and
						taverns to churches, cemeteries and government buildings. Consult the Terrain
						Chart for the game-specific characteristics of various terrain types.</p>

					 Command</a></font><br> Republique uses a very simple divisional level command
					 system. Every infantry regiment, cavalry brigade and artillery battery needs to
					 have a divisional commander in charge of it, and every divisional commander is
					 controlled by someone who issues his orders. Even in the rare case of units
					 without any official divisional commander, there will be a leader who fulfills
					 the role of a divisional officer and who is considered such for game play
					 purposes.<br> <br> At the beginning of the French Revolutionary period, the
					 highest permanent formations were usually regiments. Eventually, nations began
					 grouping regiments into permanent or provisional divisions and by the later
					 part of the wars, these divisions were grouped into permanent corps. Below is a
					 short description of each of these systems and how they are represented in
					 Republique. Related subjects such as orders and command radiuses are explained
					 later in the chapter.<br> <br> <b>Regimental Pool System</b>: Using this basic
					 system, a commander-in-chief was allotted a general pool of units which he then
					 doled out to various officers under his command. These subordinates then
					 operated their own columns or "wings," either independently or as part of a
					 larger army. During battles, the commander-in-chief would commonly assign these
					 column commanders to the army's left flank, center, right flank and advanced
					 guard. <br> <br> In Republique, the wing or column leaders function as
					 divisional commanders. They are issued <i>game orders</i> by the
					 commander-in-chief, and all units assigned to them must remain within their
					 respective command radiuses.<br> <br> <b>Divisional Wing System</b>: This is
					 similar to the previous method, except that column commanders were assigned
					 divisions and brigades instead of regiments. Each division was likely to be a
					 semi-permanent organization of infantry, artillery and/or cavalry.<br> <br> In
					 Republique, the divisional commanders operate as normal by keeping the various
					 units under their command within the required command radiuses. Column
					 commanders issue <i>game orders</i> to various divisions under their command.
					 The commander-in-chief in turn issues <i>written orders</i> to the various
					 column commanders.<br> <br> <b>Corps System</b>: In this system, autonomous
					 corps are assigned their own semi-permanent commanders and divisions. Each
					 division is permanently assigned certain regiments and has organic artillery
					 elements. Each divisional leader is given orders by the corps commander who may
					 assign additional cavalry and/or artillery assets from the corps reserve.<br>
					 <br> In Republique, corps commanders issue <i>game orders</i> to the divisional
					 leaders and may remove units (especially artillery) from the divisions and
					 assign them to corps reserve formations. They may also assign various reserve
					 units to the divisions, in which case the newly assigned units are subject to
					 divisional commander radiuses. Corps level reserve formations with their own
					 leaders operate in the same manner as divisions, receiving <i>game orders</i>
					 from the corps commander. Corps (and army) reserve units without their own
					 leaders must either be assigned to a division or assigned an
					 <i>aid-de-camp</i>, who acts as their divisional commander. Army level
					 divisions (usually reserve formations) receive <i>game orders</i> from army
					 commanders in the same manner that member divisions of a corps receive <i>game
					 orders</i> from their corps commanders.<br> <br> <br> <font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font> <a name="2.2"><font size="+2">2.2 Command
					 Radiuses</font></a><br> All units under the command of a divisional leader must
					 remain within that officer's <i>command radius</i> (CR), which is measured from
					 the edge of the commanding leader's base. The command radius represents a zone
					 of communication within which a divisional leader may automatically control
					 units under his command. Units within their divisional commander's effective
					 radius will always respond to order changes on the same turn upon which those
					 changes are successfully rolled for and changed. Units outside their divisional
					 leader's command radius are considered to have exceeded the ability to
					 communicate with them in a timely manner and have correspondingly limited
					 courses of action. This command radius system applies <i>only</i> to divisional
					 leaders and their equivalents, not to corps/army commanders, who do not have
					 command radiuses. At the end of each assault phase, divisional leaders may
					 adjust their positions by up to 8cm in order to keep within their command
					 radius those units which conducted mandatory movements during the assault
					 phase. <br> <br> There are three command categories, each of which have
					 established command radiuses and order change abilities. These categories are: 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Efficient:</i></b> 30cm command radius.
						Change orders on a die roll of 4 or higher.<br> <b><i>Functional:</i></b> 30cm
						Command radius. Change orders on a die roll of 6 or higher.<br>
						<b><i>Cumbersome:</i></b> 20cm command radius. Change orders on a die roll of 7
						or higher.<br><b><i>Useless:</i></b> 20cm command radius. Change orders on a
						die roll of 8 or higher.</blockquote> Refer to the Troop Types by Nationality
					 list for command category information for specific nations.<br> <br> <b>Leaving
					 the CR</b> - Units which leave their divisional leader's command radius because
					 of a morale failure or assault result (i.e. - due to a mandatory movement.)
					 will remain in their final position until they rally (if necessary). If after
					 rallying they are still out of the CR, they must either remain stationary under
					 an automatic defend order, continue withdrawing each turn if demoralized, or
					 move to rejoin their parent formation. While separated from their division,
					 they receive no benefits for rally orders which their division might be under
					 and they may not execute divisional orders until they rejoin their division by
					 re-entering the CR. They may however, receive rally bonuses from other leaders
					 in their chain of command or other <i>charismatic leaders</i> who are within
					 8cm. <br> <br> <b>Leaving units behind</b> - Units attempting to individually
					 rally may be left behind by divisional leaders in order to maintain the pace of
					 a move or attack order. Leaders attached to regiments continuing assaults may
					 also leave distant units behind. The units left behind suffer the same
					 restrictions as units which have retreated from a CR.<br> <br> <br> 
					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font>
						<a name="2.3"><font size="+2">2.3 Orders</font></a><br> There are two types of
						orders used to transmit commands during game play: <i>game orders</i> and
						<i>written orders</i>. Game orders are issued to divisions by their respective
						corps or army commanders. Written orders are issued to corps or columns,
						effectively limiting direct communication between participating players.
						Divisions never receive written orders, and corps/armies (or their equivalents)
						never receive game orders.</p> 
					 <p><font size="+1">Game Orders</font><br> At the beginning of
						each game, every division must be issued initial <i>game orders</i> by its
						respective corps/army commander. Official game orders are: attack, defend,
						reserve, move and rally. Once game play begins, players wishing to change a
						division's orders must first pass an order change test, which may only be
						attempted during the command phase of the controlling player's turn. To attempt
						an order change, consult the <i>Leaders</i> section of the combat chart. The
						<i>Change Orders</i> column in that section indicates the die rolls required
						for a formation of that nationality to have its orders changed. Order changes
						include switching among order types, changing a command path in any way or
						changing the configuration of a defensive area.</p>
					 <img src="docu_rules_files/rulefig_11.gif" align="LEFT" height="49" width="58"> 
					 <p><b>Move</b> - Moving divisions mark their movement route on
						the battlefield map. This <i>command path</i> is drawn as a single line
						terminated by an arrowhead. The arrowhead indicates where the division will
						stop and automatically revert to a defend order, with the attitude of the
						arrowhead indicating the division's defensive facing. The command path itself
						may be as straight or sinuous as the commanding player wishes, although players
						should keep in mind that the more complex a unit's march route, the more
						subject the unit will become to unexpected events.<br> <br> Each turn that a
						division is under move orders, it must have at least half of its units expend
						at least half of their available movement following the command path line until
						they reach their objective or come within 25cm of enemy units. While the
						division is within this 25cm <i>contact range</i>, its units may move at any
						speed required to fight properly so long as the division's overall center line
						remains within 15cm of the command arrow's route shown on the map. Note that
						this does not allow the division to back out of contact range. It must either
						hold its position in front of the enemy - within 25cm - or advance and attempt
						to attack or move through the enemy in pursuance of its movement order. </p>
					 <img src="docu_rules_files/rulefig_12.gif" align="LEFT" height="54" width="55"> 
					 <p><b>Attack</b> - Attacking divisions are assigned specific
						enemy divisions to attack. This command path is drawn on the map as a single
						line leading to the target location, which is circled. Units under attack
						orders must be within 45cm of their target at the time of the order and must
						have at least half of their units expend at least half of their available
						movement moving toward the target formation. Once within 25cm of the assigned
						enemy, all infantry and cavalry units belonging to the attacking division must
						attempt to assault the attack target's member units. Artillery assigned to the
						division may operate freely within the division's deployment area, so long as
						their actions directly support the other units in the division (IE - Artillery
						assigned to the division may not be used to support other divisions). Any enemy
						formation currently spotted by friendly forces may be assigned as attack
						targets. Direct line-of-sight observation by the attacking formation is not
						required at the time the order is issued.<br><br>Member units of an Attacking
						division may find themselves in incidental assault contact or directly
						assaulted by enemy units not part of their target (especially those present on
						the attacking division's flanks). In such cases the member units will obey
						normal assault rules and may find themselves separated from the parent
						Attacking division. In such cases follow all normal rules for separated units.
						Members units of an Attacking formation may not take part in carrying
						positions, breakthroughs or overruns that come as a result of assaults they may
						have found themselves a part of due to adjoining troop actions.<br><br>Unless
						its progress is directly obstructed by movement or assault of other enemy
						formations, an attacking division will ignore enemy formations other than those
						targeted by the Attack order (IE - they may not initiate primary assault
						contact against formations outside of the targeted enemy division). Attacking
						divisions will attempt to track and follow their assigned target even if it
						attempts to move away, adapting their command path each command phase in order
						to correct for enemy position. If during the process of moving toward a
						targeted enemy formation an attacking division's progress is directly
						obstructed by a different (non-targeted) enemy formation within 25cm range, the
						attacking division's orders are treated as Move. Whilst within the 25cm range
						of the intervening enemy formation, the Attacking division is subject to all
						normal rules that apply to moving divisions that find themselves within contact
						range of an enemy. Once the enemy formation no longer presents an obstacle to
						the Attacking division, the division may &#8211; if capable &#8211; resume its
						pursuit of the original target unless the target is no longer spotted by
						friendly forces.</p>
					 <img src="docu_rules_files/rulefig_13.gif" align="LEFT" height="19" width="65"> 
					 <p><b>Defend</b> - Divisions under defend orders must attempt
						to hold specific terrain or areas. Once placed, defending units may not
						voluntarily advance or withdraw beyond the overall defensive position. The
						center-point of the division must remain within 15cm of the center-point of the
						defensive location shown on the combat map. The defending division may expand
						or contract its frontage, so long as it remains within 15cm of its original
						center-point.</p> <img src="docu_rules_files/rulefig_14.gif" align="LEFT" height="30" width="60"> 
					 <p><b>Reserve/Restage</b> - Units may only be given reserve
						status at the start of the game. Once play begins, no units may be given a
						reserve command. Divisions in reserve must remain stationary at their original
						starting position unless:</p> 
					 <blockquote><b>a)</b> They are issued new orders during the
						Command Phase. Reserve status divisions which are issued new orders will act on
						them <i><b>without having to roll for change of orders</b></i>.<br> <b>b)</b>
						Enemy units approach within 45cm. If approached by enemy units, a division in
						reserve will immediately revert to <i>defend</i> status, losing all benefits
						that are associated with being in reserve.<br> <b>c)</b> They restage. Reserve
						divisions may <i>restage</i> by advancing one full move during a maneuver
						phase. They must pass an order change roll in order to restage and may not come
						within 45cm of any enemy unit at any time. They are still considered to be in
						reserve status at the end of the restage move.</blockquote>
					 <img src="docu_rules_files/rulefig_15.gif" align="LEFT" height="30" width="56"> 
					 <p><b>Rally</b> - All member units of a division under
						<i>rally</i> orders may use their leader's value. (instead of only those within
						8cm). The units must be within their leader's command radius and may not move
						during their upcoming maneuver phase.<br> <br> A division assaulted while under
						a rally order reverts to defend status. The division commander may not lead an
						attack or defense if the division began that turn under a rally order. When all
						the units of a rallying division successfully rally, the division automatically
						reverts to defend status.</p> <br> 
					 <p><font size="+1">Written Orders</font><br> Because most games
						of Republique involve players who command groups of divisions, all orders above
						divisional level are handled using a simple written order system. Corps or army
						commanders whose on-the-board command figures are not in base to base contact
						with each other are not allowed to discuss battle events or issue verbal orders
						to each other during the game. Instead, they exchange written notes which are
						delivered via assigned courier figures which travel 48cm per turn. If a single
						player is in charge of several corps, he is not required to send messages to
						himself, the written message system is meant purely as a control over verbal
						contact between several players on the same side.</p> 
					 <p>In order to send a written order, write the desired message
						on a sheet of paper and assign it to a courier figure during the Change Orders
						portion of the Command phase. This is best achieved by numbering all courier
						bases and then writing the respective numbers on the outside of the folded
						orders, which are then placed to one side until their delivery. During the
						following movement phase, the courier moves toward the leader to whom the
						message is aimed. At the beginning of the Change Orders segment <i>following
						the courier's arrival</i>, the message recipient may unfold and read the
						dispatched message.</p> <br> <br> <font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font> <a name="2.4"><font size="+2">2.4
					 Leaders</font></a><br> Leader figures can benefit units under their command by
					 boosting assault performance and by helping units to rally more quickly. In
					 order to lend their leadership value (if any) to an assault, leaders must be
					 attached to one of the participating units. Leaders may only attach to units
					 during the Command Phase, which is achieved by moving a leader figure into
					 direct base to base contact with a unit. Once attached, the leader may not be
					 detached until the next friendly Command Phase. While attached to a unit, a
					 leader does not lend his value to any other units under his command. See the
					 <i>Assault</i> section for details of attached leader benefits. The process of
					 attaching and detaching leaders does not affect the movement of the unit to
					 which the leader(s) are attached.<br> <br> During the Rally Phase, leaders lend
					 their value to all friendly units under their command which are within 8cm of
					 their base. If the leader is a divisional leader, and his division is under
					 rally orders, his value will apply to the rally die rolls for all units within
					 the division. Leader values are an indicator of both the particular abilities
					 of the man in question, and also an expression of the army within which he
					 commands. As a leader's value increase, his battlefield abilities also
					 increase. Note that any leader whose value is 3 is considered charismatic: 
					 <blockquote><b>"-1" leaders</b> - A minus one leader is either
						widely despised or dangerously inexperienced, and is probably viewed by the
						troops as someone who is going to get them killed. His presence hurts more than
						it helps, and he is probably in his position because he is either a (probably
						young) member of the royal family, or a guerrilla leader who has assumed
						responsibilities out of his normal area. Minus-one class leaders only inflict
						their leader modifier on units under their direct command.<br> <b>"0"
						leaders</b> - A "Zero" leader is an average officer. He serves as a conduit for
						the transmission of orders so that his divisions and other formations can
						function, and his personal commitment and/or rapport with his troops is at a
						level that is expected for the circumstances - middle of the bell curve.<br>
						<b>"1" leaders</b> - A "One" leader is definitely a cut above the rest and
						probably belonged to the top half of his class (if he attended one). Class one
						leaders only give their leader bonuses to units under their command.<br> <b>"2"
						leaders</b> - A "Two" leader displays excellent abilities and is probably being
						groomed for higher positions. Class two leaders only give their leader bonuses
						to units under their command or to units in adjoining formations of the same
						corps or wing.<br> <b>"3" leaders</b> - A "Three" leader is at the very top of
						the command chain due to some combination of intelligence and personality. In
						progressive armies, he represents the cream of the crop of the officer corps,
						with an effective combination of ability, management technique and bravery. In
						conservative armies he represents one of a tiny handful of officers with the
						connections and charisma to both retain a command and become popular with his
						troops for one of several possible reasons. Class three commanders can give
						their leader bonus to all units of the same nationality, regardless of chain of
						command.<br><b>"4" leaders</b> - A "Four" leader is either a super genius, has
						a near cult-like charisma or both. They are extremely rare and should only be
						assigned to very special cases. For Republique, probably the only commander
						assigned this value should be Napoleon Bonaparte.<br><b>National Leaders</b> -
						A national leader will usually be assigned one of the five previous ratings or
						one of their own, and can give their leader bonus to all units serving on the
						same side, regardless of nationality or chain of command.</blockquote><br>
					 <font size="+3"><a href="#0.0">«</a></font><a name="2.5"><font size="+2">2.5 Morale and Rallying</font></a> <br> <b>Morale Conditions</b> -
					 During the game, units can suffer <i>Morale Hits</i> which degrade their
					 effectiveness and increase the chances that they will attempt to spontaneously
					 withdraw. The ideal unit condition is <i>formed</i>, which represents a unit
					 fully under the control of its officers and able to perform as ordered. Formed
					 units have no morale hits. If one morale hit is suffered, the unit becomes
					 <i>unformed</i>. If the unit has not rallied when another morale hit is
					 inflicted, it will become <i>rattled</i>. If another morale hit is suffered,
					 the units become <i>shaken</i>, and if a fourth morale hit is suffered the
					 units finally becomes <i>demoralized</i>. Units with morale hits must use the
					 Rally Table on the combat chart during every rally step to see if their morale
					 condition changes (See <i><b>Rallying</b></i> below). Shown immediately below
					 are the possible morale conditions and their respective troop restrictions, if
					 any. 
					 <blockquote><b>Formed</b> - Unit behaves normally.<br>
						<b>Unformed</b> -Unit may not change formation.<br> <b>Rattled</b> - Unit may
						not change formation or deploy skirmishers. Artillery may not fire at targets
						in the last range bracket (beyond 20cm).<br> <b>Shaken</b> - Unit may not
						change formation or deploy skirmishers. Infantry will not attack cavalry or
						artillery. Cavalry will not attack artillery. Artillery may only fire at
						targets within the first two range brackets (less than 12cm).<br>
						<b>Demoralized</b> - Unit may not change formation or deploy skirmishers and
						will not voluntarily move toward any enemies. Artillery may only fire on
						targets within the first range bracket (less than 5cm). <i><b>Unit will suffer
						one panic hit for each additional morale hit inflicted upon it by skirmishers
						and/or artillery</b></i>.</blockquote> <b>Rallying</b> - During the rally step
					 of every command phase, players must attempt to rally all of their units that
					 have one or more morale hits. To make a rally attempt, follow the sequence
					 listed below: 
					 <ol> 
						<li>Take note of the rally table number that matches the
						  current condition of your unit. To do this, cross reference the troop grade and
						  morale status, this is your old rally number.</li> 
						<li>Roll one die and modify the result using the die roll
						  modifiers listed in the Rally Table on the combat chart. Apply the modified
						  result &#8211; positive or negative &#8211; to the previously noted old rally
						  number. The resulting value is your New Rally Number.</li> 
						<li>Match the new rally number with the value on the
						  corresponding rally table line to which it is equal-to or greater-than.</li> 
						<li>The morale rating listed at the top of the matching
						  column from step 3 is the unit's new morale status. Note that it is possible
						  for a unit's morale to improve, get worse or remain the same. </li> 
					 </ol> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Example:</i></b> A rattled average unit which
						has suffered 40% casualties rolls one die roll with a result of a 4. The 40%
						casualty level modifies the result downward by two points (-2), reducing it to
						a 2. That value is applied to the unit's starting value of 5 (the starting
						value for an average, rattled unit will always be a 5). This raises the unit's
						value to a 7, improving its morale level to unformed. If the die roll had been
						a 3, the modified effect on the starting value would have been a 6, which would
						have been inadequate to improve the unit's morale. If the die roll had been a
						1, the modified effect would have been a -1. This would have reduced the
						starting value to a 4, causing the unit to become shaken.</blockquote> <br> 
					 <ul><lh><b>Rally Modifiers</b></lh> 
						<li><b>Division-rally by leader</b> - If a division is under
						  a rally order and it currently has an active commander, each member unit
						  receives a +1 to its rally die roll.</li> 
						<li><b>+½R Half of Leader's Rating</b> - Add half the
						  value of a leader's combat rating to the rally roll of any units within 8cm of
						  the leader. This counts both for individual unit rally and divisional order
						  rally. Leaders with a value of "0" or "1" do not add anything. Leaders with a
						  value of "2" or "3" add one point and leaders with a value of "4" add two
						  points.</li> 
						<li><b>Heavy support within 8cm</b> - Any unit rallying
						  within 8cm of formed friendly medium, heavy or armored cavalry, elite grade
						  troops, and/or a "4" rated leader receives a +1 modifier to its rally die roll
						  for each type, cumulative to a maximum of +2. One supporting formation may
						  qualify for multiple categories, for example; elite heavy cavalry satisfies
						  both the heavy cavalry +1 and the elite grade troops +1, giving a +2 heavy
						  support modifier. A heavy support unit is only required to be formed as of the
						  moment of the rally die roll for the rallying unit, so it is always best to
						  rally elite and other heavy formations first during the rally step.</li> 
						<li><b>Each dangerous enemy nearby</b> - Units attempting to
						  rally in proximity of dangerous enemy formations may suffer a -1 to their rally
						  roll for any of the following threats, cumulative to a maximum of -2. 
						  <ul> 
							 <li>Unopposed enemy skirmishers within effective range.
								Must be effective range for the threatening skirmishers, for example only
								excellent skirmishers can be a threat at 8cm range, not good, adequate or poor
								skirmishers. </li> 
						  </ul> 
						  <ul> 
							 <li>Formed enemy heavy or armored cavalry visible within
								13cm.</li> 
						  </ul> 
						  <ul> 
							 <li>Formed or rattled enemy elite troops or artillery
								visible within 13cm.</li> 
						  </ul></li> 
						<li><b>Divisional panic victims</b> - Units belonging to a
						  division which panicked during the previous turn suffer a -1 to their rally die
						  roll for each level of panic suffered by the division. This modifier only
						  applies on the turn immediately following the divisional panic.</li> 
					 </ul> 
					 <p><b>Replacing Fallen leaders</b> - When a leader is killed,
						another may replace him during the controlling player's next command phase. The
						new leader will have a value of "0", and is only used to show the division's
						location and its ability to receive orders. Players may adjust their command
						structure to bring a more valuable leader into a vacated position. For example:
						If a "3" value corps commander is killed, instead of replacing him with a "0"
						rated commander, he could be replaced by one of his divisional commanders who
						might be a "1". The "0" value replacement is given command of the divisional
						position just vacated by the new corps commander.<br> <br> No order changes are
						permitted for a formation during the command phase following the death of their
						leader. This rule applies to divisional, corps and army level formations and
						there are no exceptions. As an additional note, the charismatic leaders rule
						may not be used to "leverage" new orders by having leaders commandeer entire
						formations which are temporarily leaderless. That rule is for use only to
						change the structure of an intact chain-of-command, not to improve the
						condition of one which is damaged. For example;</p> 
					 <blockquote>Corps Commander Lannes is wounded and carried from
						the field at the end of an artillery fire phase. None of his divisional
						commanders may receive new orders during their next command phase because the
						<i>replace leaders</i> step comes after the <i>change orders</i> step. Even if
						Napoleon is within movement range of one of Lannes' divisions, and the
						commanding player really wants to change that division's orders, he can't (i.e.
						- Napoleon may not ride up to the division and verbally change that division's
						orders). The injury to Lannes is considered to have "damaged" not only the
						officer, but also the command and communications for his corps and its
						superiors. For further explanation, see the <i><a href="http://www.wtj.com/games/beta/republique/docu_qa.htm" target="">Questions &amp; Answers</a></i> section.</blockquote> </td>

						troop types may also use an assault movement bonus (also called charge
						movement), any portion of which may be used during the course of a turn. Normal
						infantry and cavalry charge bonuses are 8cm and 13cm respectively. This extra

						<a name="3.2"><font size="+2">3.2 Maneuvering</font></a><br> All troops used
						for game play are considered to be operating under one of the two basic systems
						of maneuver which were used during this era; the Prussian system and the French
						system. The outcome of a battle can be dramatically effected by the selection
						of maneuver systems employed. Players will not usually be able to choose which
						maneuver system to use. The time period within which a scenario is staged will
						usual be the deciding factor on which maneuver system is used by an army. The
						following outlines explain the two systems and how they are represents in
						Republique.<br> <br> <b>Prussian Maneuver System</b> - The Prussian system of
						maneuver was used by most nations of Europe for a great part of the French
						Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. The system was a product of the pre-modern
						era and required a complex series of evolutions in order to complete most
						formation changes. Because a majority of European governments had closely
						imitated Prussian maneuver doctrine for years, all countries fighting against
						France during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Periods should be considered to
						be on the Prussian system unless otherwise specified. See the troop lists by
						nationality (listed on the main Republique page) for more information.</p> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Game Effects:</i></b> In Republique, units on
						the Prussian system suffer the following movement limitations: Wheeling,
						oblique movement and passing through other combat units counts as rough (double
						normal cost). Moving sideways counts as double rough movement (quadruple normal
						cost). Changing formation subtracts 15cm from movement.</blockquote> 
					 <p><b>French Maneuver System</b> - The French system of
						tactical maneuver was pioneered by Comte de Guibert after many years of
						research following the Seven Years War. An interesting historical note:
						Guibert's system was not known as the French system during this period. It was
						still considered a variation of the Prussian system and was referred to as
						such. However, the system itself and the grand-tactical innovations which
						accompanied it can be fairly separated into a separate system for purposes of
						game play. <br><br>This new system allowed units to split off by files to their
						new positions instead of awkwardly wheeling by sub-units. Such simple
						improvements greatly reduced the time needed to change formation, giving units
						who used the system a tactical advantage against enemies who still used a more
						rigid maneuver system. The new system was approved by the French government in
						1791, and the benefits were quickly apparent. Russia, Austria and Prussia
						probably did not implement their versions of the system until after 1812.
						France's German allies were probably converted to the new system by 1808.
						Britain appears to have adopted their own variation of the Prussian system
						which was efficient enough to be rated in the same category as the French
						system. </p> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Game Effects:</i></b> In Republique, units on
						the French system may wheel, pass through other units, move diagonally and move
						sideways at normal movement rates. Changing formation subtracts 5cm from
						movement. </blockquote>

					 allowances). Skirmish markers must remain within 8cm of their parent unit for
					 <i>line</i> infantry based skirmishers, and within 15cm of their parent unit

					 give ground) to enemy combat bases and &#8211; if displaced &#8211; have the
					 following options: 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Fighting Withdrawal:</i></b> If displaced by
						enemy units which are not moving to initiate an assault that will involve their

						optional rule: <a href="http://www.wtj.com/games/beta/republique/docu_optional.htm#dispersing" target="">Dispersing
						Skirmishers</a>). </blockquote> Any skirmish markers which fire during the
					 artillery phase may <i>not</i> rejoin a parent unit at all for the remainder of
					 that player turn.<br> <br> <b>Cavalry</b> - Cavalry units may react to enemy
					 units which <i>advance</i> to within 15cm of their front during an opposing
					 player's Maneuver Phase. Reacting cavalry may begin moving as soon as enemy
					 units approach to within line of sight or 15cm, whichever is less. Both sides
					 then pro-rate their movement until the reacting cavalry and enemy formations
					 have either completed their movement, contacted or approached within primary
					 assault range. Reacting cavalry may not change formation. <br><br>Reacting
					 cavalry may leave its divisional command radius and may react while out of

					 are two types of movement for artillery; <i>Limbered</i> and <i>Prolong</i>.
					 Limbered artillery is attached to a wheeled carriage drawn by horses. Prolong
					 is unlimbered cannon being drawn by men or horses while in a "fire ready"
					 condition. <br> <br> In order to accomplish both movement and firing, each
					 artillery battery may execute several specific functions during the course of a
					 turn. The available functions are: Move, Unlimber, Fire, Prolong and Limber.
					 Foot artillery may conduct two functions each turn, and horse artillery may
					 conduct three functions. For example; a foot battery may move and unlimber
					 during its movement phase but it may not fire on its following fire phase. If
					 it were to unlimber in place (without moving), it could then fire on its
					 upcoming fire phase. Batteries may not use the same function more than once
					 each turn (i.e. - may not prolong twice during the same movement phase, etc.).

						disorder in enemy combat formations. All skirmish bases within range of enemy
						troops will fall into one of two categories: opposed or unopposed.</p> 
					 <blockquote><b>Opposed Skirmishers</b> - A skirmish marker may
						declare any enemy skirmish marker in any direction and within 8cm of it to be
						<i>opposed</i>. Opposed skirmish bases are considered to be effectively blocked
						or "screened" and may not fire on enemy combat bases that turn. If uneven

						not opposed by enemy skirmishers may conduct harassing fire against enemy
						combat units. Each available skirmish marker may attack once per turn by
						rolling a ten-sided die (1D10) and referring to the <i>Skirmishing</i> section
						of the combat chart for range limits and results. Each morale hit scored on the
						targeted unit(s) will lower morale by one. A normal unit becomes disordered, a

						<a name="4.2"><font size="+2">4.2 Artillery Fire</font></a><br> During each
						Artillery Fire step, artillery batteries for both sides may either fire upon
						enemy units or announce that they are saving their fire, which will increase
						the effectiveness of their next volley. A firing battery has an effective
						arc-of-fire totalling 60 degrees measured from the outer front edges of its
						base. Several artillery batteries may total their points against a single
						target for better effect if they do not violate the <i>Main Target</i> rule as
						a result (see <a href="#Targets" target="">Targets</a>). In order to conduct
						artillery fire, repeat the following sequence for each battery, group of
						batteries or massed battery:</p> 
					 <blockquote> <b>Step 1:</b> Use the range lines on the fire
						chart to find the fire points for the firing batteries. Total the fire points
						for all qualified batteries. <br> <b>Step 2:</b> Double or halve fire points
						according to the point modifiers. <br> <b>Step 3:</b> Roll 1D10 and add or
						subtract the applicable die modifiers. <br> <b>Step 4:</b> Cross index the
						appropriate line of the fire point column on the <i>Artillery </i>chart with
						the modified die results. Above each of the <i>die result</i> columns are
						listed the morale and base hits which the target unit(s) will suffer as a
						result.<br> <br> </blockquote> An artillery battery may only fire once each
					 player turn (twice each full turn), although fire is not mandatory. Limbered
					 batteries may not fire. A battery whose morale is shaken or worse may not fire.
					 Damaged batteries are silenced if they also have any morale hits. Artillery may
					 not fire through or over friendly units, including skirmishers. A unit
					 completely destroyed by artillery fire does not cause panic hits in the rest of
					 its division.<br> <br> All standard artillery fire conducted during the
					 Artillery Phase is considered simultaneous. Batteries which suffer damage
					 within the same phase will not have their damage effects applied until it's
					 end. Prolonged artillery is excepted. Batteries which prolonged during the
					 preceding movement will lose simultaneous fire privilege against enemy
					 artillery (see artillery movement).<br> <br> <b>Saving Fire</b> - At the start
					 of the Artillery Fire segment, any ordered, stationary artillery battery may be
					 announced as <i>saving fire</i>. The battery may not fire that phase and must
					 remain completely stationary. Place a <i>saved fire</i> marker with the battery
					 to represent the prepared status of the battery. The next time that the battery
					 fires, the fire points expended are doubled, and the saved fire status is lost.
					 If a battery with saved fire moves <i>in any way</i>, the saved fire status is
					 lost (this includes changing facing or prolonging). Each artillery battery may
					 only accumulate a maximum of <i>one</i> saved fire marker at any one time.
					 Saved fire markers may not be stockpiled or traded among batteries. Artillery
					 which is out of command radius may not save fire. A battery with saved fire
					 status receives a bonus if involved in primary or incidental assault contact.
					 Involvement in an assault causes all participating batteries to lose saved fire

					 <ul> 
						<li><b>Passing Fire</b> - Battery is conducting opportunity
						  fire during enemy movement. Enemy infantry and cavalry must be within firing
						  battery's arc-of-fire for 8cm and 15cm of their movement respectively. Subtract
						  <b><i>2</i></b> points from die roll.</li>

					 </ul> 
					 <ul> 
						<li><b>Each Level Difference</b> - Each <i>full</i> elevation
						  level difference between a battery and its target subtracts <b><i>1</i></b>
						  point from the die roll. This represents the unfavorable nature of plunging
						  fire onto lower targets and the defensive measure of using hillsides as

						<a name="4.5"><font size="+2">4.5 Targets</font></a><br> <b>Main Targets</b> -
						Each artillery battery must fire at the unit which is; 1) the <i>closest
						threat</i>, i.e. - the closest unit occupying the closest artillery range
						bracket to the battery, and 2) closest to the battery's Center of Fire.
						Different batteries may only converge their fire onto one unit if these rules
						are not violated as a result or if a good artillery leader is attached to a
						massed battery. Any individual or massed artillery battery with a qualified
						artillery leader attached to it may selectively or wholly converge fire onto
						any enemy targets which are in the <i>closest threat</i> bracket.</p> 
					 <p><b>Secondary Targets</b> - Secondary targets are units which
						suffer collateral damage due to their close proximity to main targets. There
						are two types of secondary targets: tandem and adjacent. Tandem secondary
						targets may suffer damage both in place of, and <i>in addition</i> to the main
						target. Adjacent secondary targets only suffer damage in place of the main
						target. If both types of secondary targets are near a main target, an adjacent
						target will only suffer hits if both main and tandem targets are
						eliminated.</p> 
					 <blockquote><b><i>Tandem Target</i>:</b> A tandem secondary
						target is any unit which is within the attacking battery's <i>firing zone</i>
						and within 5cm of the main target's front. Tandem secondary targets must also
						be in open terrain and may not be fully deployed light regiments. Secondary
						tandem targets always suffer half the number of morale hits as the main target
						<i><b>in addition to the main target's morale hits.</b></i> They also share
						half of the total base hits rolled on the artillery fire chart, always rounding
						down. If all bases in the main target are killed, the unit in the tandem target
						position closest to attacking battery center-line will suffer the balance of
						the required base hits. <br> <br> <b><i>Adjacent Target</i>:</b> An adjacent
						secondary target is any unit within the firing battery's <i>firing zone</i>
						which is next to, and within the same range bracket as, the main target. If all
						the bases in the main target unit are destroyed as a result of one die roll and
						there are no tandem targets, the adjacent secondary target closest to attacking
						battery center-line will suffer the balance of the required base hits and
						morale hits not absorbed by the original main target. </blockquote> 
					 <p><b>Compound Targets</b> - If different unit types are
						targeted as a result of either the <i>Deep target</i> or <i>Secondary
						target</i> rules, use the modifiers most favorable to the battery. Enemy
						artillery batteries which are positioned within 2cm of each other may be
						treated as single <i>compound targets</i> for purposes of artillery fire.</p> 
					 <p><b>Firing zone</b> - A battery's <i>firing zone</i> is a
						cone-shaped area beginning at an artillery battery's front through which
						battery fire is directed at targets. The firing zone is tapered outward 20°
						and may be swung throughout a battery's 60° degree arc-of-fire. It must be
						free of friendly combat bases (or any parts thereof) and markers in order for
						the battery to be able to fire. The firing zone should not be confused with the
						arc-of-fire, which is the stationary zone representing a battery's available
						firing arc.</p> 
					 <p><b>Arc of Fire</b> - A battery's <i>arc of fire</i> is a
						cone-shaped area beginning at an artillery battery's front through which the
						battery's firing zone may be swung in order to establish whether a potential
						target can be fired upon. The arc-of-fire itself is tapered outward 60° and
						is locked in a stationary position onto the battery front &#8211; it may not be
						moved or swung into different positions in order to bring potential targets
						into the arc. Half or more of one of a formations bases must lie within a
						battery's arc-of-fire in order to quality as a valid target. The outer edges of
						the arc-of-fire are marked "60° Maximum Arc" as emphasis of the limits on
						the battery's effective field of fire.</p> 
					 <p><b>Passing Fire</b> - Artillery may <i>Pass Fire</i> at any
						enemy unit moving across its front (more than 45 degrees from perpendicular).
						Batteries saving fire may not use passing fire. Those batteries which conduct
						passing fire may not fire during the following artillery phase, and they do not
						receive saved fire as a result of that missed phase.</p> <br> <br>

						units which have approached to within 25mm of each other during movement must
						now enter into the assault phase. This phase represents the musket volleys,
						melees, charges and countercharges which occur in the confusion of close
						combat. Each unit involved in an assault must apply its entire strength to that
						assault if the nearest portion of an enemy unit is within 25mm of its <i>facing
						arc</i>. This is defined as <i>primary</i> contact. A unit whose nearest
						portion is more than 25mm but less than 50mm must apply half of its strength
						(rounding up) to the assault. This is called <i>incidental</i> contact. A
						unit's <i>facing arc</i> is measured 45 degrees from the rear corners of its
						furthest left and right front base(s), up the sides of those bases and from the
						front edges all front bases. Only a unit facing within 25mm of an enemy unit or
						units is able to initiate an assault, thereby drawing in nearby
						<i>incidental</i> units. Purely incidental contact cannot initiate an assault.
						Skirmisher markers do not interfere with assault proximity and do not apply
						their bases to the assault. Each assault is resolved on the Assault section of
						the Combat Chart as follows: </p> 
					 <blockquote><b>Step 1:</b> Each player totals his modifiers and
						applies them to the result of one ten sided die roll.<br> <b>Step 2:</b> The
						attacker then subtracts the defender's modified result from his own to arrive
						at the <i>die roll difference</i>.<br> <b>Step 3:</b> Refer to the die roll
						difference values shown in the die roll box located down the center of the
						assault section of the Combat Chart. High rolling attacker values (winners) are
						in the upper half and low rolling attacker values (losers) are in the lower
						half.<br> <b>Step 4:</b> Immediately apply the results to the involved units
						according to the attacker type. All initial assaults must be resolved before
						breakthrough assaults and continuing movement are carried out. Mark
						breakthrough locations before moving on to resolve other assaults.<br> <b>Step
						5:</b> Leaders which have been attached to units involved in the current
						assault round must roll for possible injury or death. A leader who has led an
						emergency rally must also roll for injury if the assault in question occurred
						as a result of the emergency rally.<br> <b>Step 6:</b> After the first "round"
						of assaults is resolved, conduct all breakthrough movements and other mandatory
						movements (if any) required by the assault results. Then repeat steps 1 through
						5 for any additional assault rounds which are required to be
						resolved.</blockquote> 
					 <p>Some assault results may trigger several rounds of die
						rolling before final resolution. As long as enemy units continue to face within
						25mm of each other, they will continue to trigger new assaults. <i>Stalled
						assaults</i> occur when units required by the rules to continue or breakthrough
						have insufficient movement to do so (see assault results).</p>

					 contact with fresh assault targets. Such <i>local breakthroughs</i> may not
					 violate standing divisional orders. Players intending to move qualifying units

					 be completed before assault resolution begins.<br><br><b>Bridging
					 Formations</b> - When an attacking unit is facing in base-to-base primary
					 contact with two different enemy formations as part of a broader assault
					 involving numerous regiments, the attacking player may choose to split that
					 unit's participation into two different assaults instead of allowing that one
					 <i>bridging formation</i> to combine the greater group into a large and
					 potentially unwieldy assault calculation. The following factors must be met
					 into order to split a bridging formation for participation in two different
					 assaults: 
					 <ol> 
						<li>The attacking unit's base split must correspond as much
						  as possible to the boundary between the two defending assault blocks.</li> 
						<li>Only the attacker (phasing player) may split units. The
						  defender for the turn may not.</li> 
						<li>The bridging formation must respond to assault results in
						  a way which will preserve the unit's integrity &#8211; it may not split up. For
						  example, if one assault result calls for a bridging unit to advance and the
						  other calls for the unit to fall back, the unit must fall back in order to
						  preserve its integrity.</li> 
						<li>Panic and morale hits on bridging units are not
						  cumulative. Only the worst single cases per assault round will apply, although
						  the worst cases for each type (panic, morale, etc) may originate from different
						  assaults. For example, if one assault inflicts 2M and 2P on the attacking force
						  and another assault inflicts 3M and 2P on the other attacking force, a bridging
						  formation split between the two assaults will receive 3M and 2P.</li> 
						<li>The attacking player is not allowed to pre-calculate the
						  various possible odds and modifier combinations for an assault before declaring
						  whether a bridging formation (if present) will or will not be split. The
						  decision must be made based on an brief examination of the final unit
						  dispositions at the end of the maneuver phase and should not take more than
						  thirty seconds.</li> 
					 </ol><br><br> <b>Artillery</b> - Each unlimbered artillery
					 battery within assault range of an enemy unit counts as one combat base in the
					 same manner as an infantry or cavalry base. A massed artillery battery (several
					 batteries with bases touching) counts as one unit, with each base also
					 equalling one regular combat base. A limbered artillery battery counts as one
					 base, but may not contribute to incidental assault contact.<br><br>Artillery
					 hit by a breakthrough assault may not fire at the assaulting units, however
					 they may receive the following tactical bonuses if any of the attacking bases
					 are within the battery's arc-of-fire: Artillery which did not fire on the
					 current player turn receives a Bonus C of +1 on the assault die roll; Artillery
					 with saved fire receives a Bonus B of +2 on the assault die roll, and if it is
					 a single battery it may re-face up to 45º to bring attacking bases into
					 its arc-of-fire. Massed batteries may not re-face, nor may their member

					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#top">«</a></font><a name="5.4"><font size="+2">5.4 Assault Results</font></a> <br> <b>Hits and
						Losses</b> - Both attacking and defending units may suffer morale hits, base
						hits and panic hits as a result of their primary or incidental involvement in
						an assault. All results for each round of assault combat are applied
						simultaneously, as are the mandatory movements which may be required. </p> 
					 <blockquote> <b>Morale hits</b> - All primary and incidental
						units involved in an assault will suffer the number of morale hits called for
						by the assault chart results. Affected units are immediately marked with the
						corresponding hits markers to show their new condition. All requirements to
						roll again are done so with modifiers adjusted for the new morale
						condition(s).<br> <br> <b>Base hits</b> - Base hits inflicted due to assault
						results are first distributed randomly among units which were within closest
						primary contact with the enemy units. Only if all primary contact bases are
						lost will remaining unassigned base hits be allotted to incidental contact
						units. Bases lost due to base hits are removed immediately from play, and
						before surrender results are applied. If possible, base hits should be removed
						from the middle of a unit in order to avoid biasing established assault
						contact(s). <br> <br> <b>Panic Hits</b> - Panic hits control the manner in
						which units respond to their assault loss. To find a unit's panic response,
						refer to the corresponding panic level in the Panic Index, and cross reference
						the troop grade of the losing units with that panic level's assault column. The
						results shown indicate the type of mandatory movement which the losing unit
						must conduct, either W (withdrawal), F (fall back), Re (retreat) or Rt (rout).
						Surviving artillery batteries may limber-up in order to withdraw, fall back or
						retreat. Artillery batteries required to rout are abandoned (captured)
						regardless of other results.<br><br>If retreating or routing units pass through
						a friendly formation which was not involved in the assault and they outnumber
						it by 3:1 or more, that formation suffers two morale hits and the same panic
						hit(s) as the assault losers, responding accordingly. Formations <i>carried
						away</i> in this manner are not subject to the surrender loss
						result.<br><br>The panic result may also include a <i>loss number</i>, which
						represents the number of bases which must surrender to the enemy as a result of
						the assault. Losers required to surrender bases will do so only after base hits
						have been withdrawn. Surrendering bases are taken first from primary contact
						units of the lowest troop grade present, followed by higher troop grade bases
						within primary contact. Only if all primary contact bases are lost may
						remaining unassigned surrenders be taken from incidental contact units. If a
						unit is completely destroyed during the course of the assault phase, the parent
						division must still check for panic (does not apply to a unit destroyed during
						the artillery phase, even if that unit was already in assault
						contact).<br><br><br> <i>Example</i>: A veteran grade unit suffers two panic
						hits as a result of an assault. The controlling player will refer to the second
						line of the <b>Panic 2</b> index column (the second line corresponds with the
						Veteran troop grade units). The <b>Result</b> column indicates an <b>F</b>,
						meaning that the unit will fall back without further loss. If the unit had been
						composed of green quality troops, it would have received a <b>Rt-1</b> result,
						which would result in one rout move, and the loss of one base as prisoners.
						<br><br> <br> <b>Carry Position</b> - Attacking formations allowed to carry a
						position are permitted to advance into the position originally taken up by the
						enemy units before their departure. Carrying a position allows a unit a certain
						amount of latitude to adjust their orientation, but only if they have
						sufficient movement allowance remaining. This includes any limbered artillery
						involved in an assault, which may also participate in a move to carry a
						position including unlimbering in support of other friendly formations. <br>
						<br> <b>Breakthrough</b> - Assault results may either allow or order attackers
						to continue moving to assault contact, which is called a breakthrough. While
						conducting this continuing movement, they are subject to normal movement rules
						and may initiate new assaults against units. They may not violate or exceed
						their current orders while breaking through, nor may they exceed their maximum
						movement allowance as measured from the start of their movement phase. Units
						whose assault results state that they <i>must</i> breakthrough will move to the
						limit of their full assault movement (even if movement orders are violated as a
						result) unless countermanded by a new assault result. Units which use their
						assault movement bonus will suffer one morale hit at the end of the turn. Units
						which <i>may</i> breakthrough have the option of downgrading their breakthrough
						option to a mandatory <i>carry position</i> result.<br> <br> <b>Overrun</b> -
						An overrun allows assaulting cavalry to break past or through a defeated
						defender (if any remains) and to continue moving to assault contact against
						potential assault targets to the rear of the defeated defender. The cavalry may
						continue assaulting units in this manner as long as it has the available
						movement and continues to achieve assault results allowing further movement and
						action. Cavalry which remains in primary contact with an enemy unit due to
						refusal to conduct a voluntary breakthrough must conduct further assault rounds
						until the primary contact is broken. If no other enemy units are within range
						of a cavalry unit's remaining post-overrun movement allowance, the cavalry may
						still overrun the defender and expend movement to the maximum allowable as part
						of a general penetration of enemy lines. <br><br>In cases where an enemy unit
						suffers panic hits that keep it in the path of an overrunning cavalry formation
						&#8211; especially in cases where the cavalry runs out of available movement
						&#8211; a second assault round may result. This can give the effect of a
						prolonged running down of the panicking defenders.<br> <br> <b>Break off</b> -
						Allows assaulting cavalry to utilize their remaining movement (if any) to move
						out of primary assault contact with the enemy. This results in one morale hit
						on the units that break-off, with the morale hit applied immediately upon
						completing the break off move. The cavalry may instead utilize a full normal
						move in order to break off, however that will result in two morale hits applied
						immediately upon completion of the break off move.<br><br><b>Capture
						Artillery</b> - The corresponding number are captured, either half of artillery
						bases present or all present. If on the same player turn the capturing troops
						lose breakthrough assaults which result in a loss of the position which contain
						the captured artillery, the captured artillery is marked off as destroyed
						instead of captured. Note that regardless of other assault results, artillery
						which rout due to panic hits are considered abandoned and therefore
						captured.<br><br><b>Capture Officer</b> - Either half or all of the officers
						attached to the assaulting side are captured. For the half-captured result, if
						one or two officers are present, one of them is considered captured. If three
						or more officers are attached, two are considered captured.</blockquote>Units
					 unable to withdraw, retreat or rout away from the enemy without coming in
					 contact with other enemy combat bases will surrender. All <i>breakthrough</i>,
					 <i>break-off</i> and <i>overrun</i> moves are carried out after the first
					 assault round is completed. Subsequent assault rounds are conducted in the same
					 manner.<br><br> <b>Stalled Assaults</b> - Assaulting units which have
					 insufficient remaining movement to execute breakthrough or break-off orders are
					 <i>stalled</i>. Stalled units must conduct further assault rounds against their
					 opposing enemy formations until they are no longer facing within the 25mm
					 assault range of each other.<br><br> <b>Artillery effects</b> - If their
					 results are not separated from the main assault results by a comma (typical
					 with infantry attackers) artillery batteries suffer the same results as other
					 assault losers and are subject to the same morale and panic hits. Additional
					 artillery effects such as damage or capture may also be called for by the
					 assault results, either partially or in full. <br><br>For artillery results
					 that are separated from the main results by a comma (typical with cavalry
					 attackers) the artillery suffers only the results shown to the right of the
					 comma. <b><i>Note that portions of the cavalry results column include both
					 types of artillery results</i></b> (with and without commas).<br><br><b>Mixed
					 Assaults</b> - If both infantry and cavalry attack victoriously together in a
					 single assault, each attacking unit will use the reaction column corresponding
					 to their type: cavalry using the cavalry column reactions and the infantry
					 using the infantry column reactions. Attacking cavalry may ignore the cavalry
					 reaction if the participating infantry rolls again for a new assault round. In
					 such a case, the cavalry &#8211; which otherwise might be forced to breakthrough
					 or break off &#8211; may instead adopt the infantry's reaction and remain to
					 participate in the new assault round.<br><br>Defenders which lose to a mixed
					 infantry/cavalry force will suffer the combination of the worst possible
					 effects for the corresponding result line, including morale, panic and base
					 hits, artillery damage and officer losses. <br><br> 
					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#top">«</a></font>
						<font size="+2"><a name="5.5">5.5 Emergency Rally</a></font><br> Upon losing
						any assault, the commander of the losing side may use local unattached officer
						figures to attempt an <i>emergency rally</i> of units which lost the just-ended
						assault. Emergency Rallies may be attempted on any unit(s) within 8cm of the
						rallying leader, and are conducted before moving the losing unit(s).</p> 
					 <blockquote> <b>Step 1:</b> Announce the Rallying leader.<br>
						<b>Step 2:</b> Roll on the leader injury chart using the +4 emergency rally
						modifier and any other modifiers which apply. Note that the <i>leading
						attack/defense</i> modifier and the <i>emergency rally</i> modifier should
						never be used together, since leaders already attached (i.e. - leading) may not
						conduct emergency rallies.<br> <b>Step 3:</b> If the leader survives, he may
						roll to rally the friendly unit(s), <b><i>applying double his normal
						value</i></b> and any other modifiers which apply. If the unit(s) rallies, a
						new assault round is immediately resolved, with the rallied unit(s) occupying
						their original positions, and the bonus for the leader applied as if he were
						attached to the rallied forces (even though he is not).</blockquote> 
					 <p>Leaders may only conduct one emergency rally per assault
						phase. They may however, simultaneously emergency rally several units who all
						participated in the same losing assault round. Assaulting cavalry may ignore
						successful emergency rallies and continue with an overrun or break-off move. In
						either case, the rallied unit will reform in its original position and facing,
						behind the assaulting cavalry if necessary. Infantry who successfully emergency
						rally against cavalry may form square.</p> 
					 <p><b>Complete Rally</b> - In the event that all the units in a
						division successfully rally, all panic hits in that division are
						eliminated.</p> 
					 <p><font size="+3"><a href="#top">«</a></font>
						<a name="5.6"><font size="+2">5.6 Injury and Disorder</font></a><br> <b>Leader
						Injuries</b> - Roll 1D10 for each leader who was within 8cm of any unit

						already rolled for injury due to direct participation in assault rounds or
						emergency rallies are exempt from this final roll. Definitions for the injury

						Injuries &amp; Withdrawal</a> section of the Artillery &amp; Skirmish Fire
						phase.</p> <b>Charge Disorder</b> - Units which use any of their assault bonus
					 movement (also known as charge movement) during the turn will suffer <i>charge
					 disorder</i> at that turn's end. Units suffering charge disorder suffer one
					 morale hit, but only after all assaults, emergency rallies and counterattacks
					 are resolved.<br><br><b>End of Phase</b> - At the end of the assault phase,
					 both sides may remove existing bases lost and close ranks of units which have
					 suffered base hits by moving their bases back into contact. Units may close
					 ranks on the center of the unit, to the left or to the right, so long as one

				  <td align="LEFT" valign="TOP"><font size="+3"><a href="#top">«</a></font> <a name="6.1"><font size="+2">6.1 Panic Test
					 Procedure</font></a><br> Panic tests are conducted at the end of a turn by any
					 divisions which have suffered traumatic events during the course of the turn
					 sequence. These panic tests use the same chart as the panic hits which occur
					 during the assault phase. However, divisional panic tests employ the chart in a
					 slightly different manner.<br> <br> In order to conduct a divisional panic
					 test, establish the failure value by cross-indexing the average troop grade of
					 the testing division with the <i>failure</i> column on the appropriate panic
					 index. The specific panic index to be used will be dictated by the
					 circumstances described in section <a href="#5.2">5.2</a> below, and is
					 modified by all applicable panic level modifiers. Once the failure value is
					 established, the player controlling the division then rolls one die and
					 modifies its result using the failure roll modifiers. If the modified die roll
					 value equals or exceeds the previously established failure value, the division
					 is immediately marked as being in a panicked state and all member units will
					 conduct the resulting forced movement listed immediately to the left of the
					 failure column (withdraw, fall back, retreat or rout).<br> <br> Units within
					 the division which have already conducted other forced retrograde moves during
					 the current phase do not move a second time. If a <i>loss number</i> is shown
					 to the right of the panic result, the division will lose that number of bases
					 to desertion. Deserting bases are taken randomly, first from the lowest troop
					 grade present, followed by progressively higher troop grades within the
					 division. Deserted bases are removed from game play and not returned unless
					 playing multiple-day scenarios. Once all panic test rounds have been resolved,
					 all panic markers are removed from affected divisions and the next turn is
					 begun.<br> <br> <br> <br> <font size="+3"><a href="#top">«</a></font>
					 <a name="6.2"><font size="+2">6.2 When to Test</font></a><br> There are three
					 different conditions which can trigger divisional panic tests. If more than one
					 condition happens to a division, it will simultaneously roll one die for each
					 condition, suffering the worst result which occurs. Because panic test failures
					 can trigger panic tests in adjoining divisions, the panic test phase is
					 conducted in "rounds" during which progressive groups of divisions will roll
					 for panic. All panic tests conducted within a test round are considered to be
					 simultaneous, and resulting mandatory movements are executed only after all
					 necessary die rolls for that round have been conducted. <br> <br> <b><i>1)
					 Death of a leader</i></b> - If a leader is killed at any point during a player
					 turn, all divisions within his chain of command must roll for panic failure
					 during the Panic Test Phase. Note that the death of a commander in chief
					 results in a panic test for every division in his army.<br> <b><i>2) Internal
					 Panic</i></b> - A division must roll for division-wide panic if any of its
					 units suffered panic hits during the assault phase. The division will roll on
					 the panic level which corresponds to the highest number of panic hits suffered
					 by any one of its units during the current player turn. For example: if three
					 regiments in a division suffered panic hits, with two suffering two hits each,
					 and a third suffering one hit, the division in question will roll for possible
					 panic failure using panic level two. If any unit within the division had
					 suffered three panic hits, this would cause the division to roll on the failure
					 column for panic level three.<br> <b><i>3) Adjoining Panic</i></b> - A division
					 will roll on the panic index if any adjoining division within 8cm becomes
					 panicked during the Panic Test Phase. Divisions are considered adjoining if the
					 closest points of their closest units are within 8cm of each other, or within
					 line of sight, whichever is less. This "inter-divisional" panic always starts
					 at the same level of panic as that suffered and tested for by the adjoining
					 division.<br> <br> Each division may only test once for each panic condition
					 during the course of a panic phase. For example; if a division passes an
					 <i>internal panic</i> test, only to have an adjoining division fail a similar
					 test, the subject division must then roll an <i>adjoining panic</i> test. If
					 however, it passes that panic test only to have yet another adjoining division
					 fail during the same round (or any subsequent round of that phase), it will not
					 have to roll a second adjoining panic test.<br> <br> <br> <font size="+3"><a href="#top">«</a></font> <a name="6.3"><font size="+2">6.3 Panic
					 Modifiers</font></a><br> <a name="pmods"></a><b>Panic Level Modifiers:</b> The
					 following modifiers increase or decrease the panic levels of the testing
					 divisions. For example; moving up one panic level will cause a player already
					 rolling on the <b>Panic 2</b> failure column to now roll on the <b>Panic 3</b>
					 failure column. 
					 <ul> 
						<li><b>C-in-C Killed</b> - Move up one panic level if the
						  Commander in Chief of the army to which the division belongs is killed. Note
						  that the death of a C-in-C will cause every division in that army to roll on
						  the Panic Index</li> 
						<li><b>Charismatic Leader Killed</b> - Move up one panic
						  level if a charismatic leader killed during the current phase was within the
						  testing division's chain of command.</li> 
						<li><b>Adjoining panicked division is heavy support</b>- Move
						  up one panic level if a panicked adjoining division counts as a heavy support
						  formation (elite troops grade or cavalry).</li> 
						<li><b>Adjoining intact division is heavy support</b>- Move
						  down one panic level if an adjoining intact division (i.e. - one which is not
						  panicked) is a heavy support formation (elite grade troops or cavalry).</li> 
					 </ul> <br> <b>Failure Roll Modifiers:</b> The following
					 modifiers are added or subtracted from failure die rolls. All modifiers are
					 cumulative. 
					 <ul> 
						<li><b>Dead leader value</b> - Add the values of all
						  applicable dead leader to the panic roll of all divisions under the leader's
						  command.</li> 
						<li><b>Each demoralized unit</b>- Add <b><i>1</i></b> to the
						  failure die roll for each unit within the division which is demoralized or
						  which has been destroyed.</li> 
						<li><b>Division is intact</b>- Subtract <b><i>1</i></b> from
						  the failure die roll if no units in the division have any morale hits.</li>
